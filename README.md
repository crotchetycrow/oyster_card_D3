# oyster_card

Creating a project that acts like an oyster card.


1. Create a Gemfile
- [x] Construct a valid Gemfile
- [x] Specify a correct source for gems
- [x] Specify the latest Ruby version
- [x] Add the rspec gem to ‘test’ and ’development’ groups
- [x] Commit only this Gemfile

  DONE

2. Create RSpec conventional files
- [x] Generate conventional files (helper and config) for an RSpec project using a command-line option of the rspec executable file
- [x] Follow RSpec naming convention for files and folders
- [x] Create a test file for the Oystercard class without any tests but with a describe block (doesn't exist yet)

  DONE

3. Learn debugging basics
- [x] Write down the file path where the error happened
*/Users/jackhooper/Documents/Makers/Week Two - (Full Course)/oyster_card/spec/oystercard_spec.rb*
- [x] Write down the line number of the error
*rb:2*
- [x] Use the Ruby Documentation to find out what the error means
*There is no Oystercard class so cannot produce anything*
- [x] Suggest one way of solving the error
*Create an Oystercard class in a lib dir*

  DONE

4. Add the balance
- [x] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [x] Create a unit test for the Oystercard class
- [x] Write a failing test that checks that a new card has a balance
- [x] Write code that will make this test pass
- [x] Now refactor by setting the balance in initialize using an instance variable
- [x] Remove the balance method entirely and replace with an attr_reader

  DONE

5. Enable top up functionality
- [x] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [x] Write a test for the top_up method
- [x] Make sure the test fails before implementing the method
- [x] Implement the method to make the test pass

DONE

6. Enforce maximum balance
- [x] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [x] Write a test that checks the `top_up` method throws an exception if the new balance would exceed the limit.
- [x] Use a constant to store the limit
- [x] Implement the limit in the top_up method. Use an inline `if` statement to check if the limit would be exceeded
- [x] Make the error message include the limit value
- [x] Use interpolation to keep your code DRY

  DONE

7. Deduct the money
- [x] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [x] Write a test for the `deduct` method, see it fail
- [x] Implement the method, see the test pass

  DONE

8. Add touch in/out support
- [x] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [x] Write tests for `in_journey?`, `touch_in` and `touch_out`
- [x] Write implementation of these methods that will make the tests pass
- [x] Use an instance variable to track whether the card is in use
- [x] Use an RSpec predicate matcher to check if the card is in use
- [x] Use boolean values to store the state of the card

  DONE

9. Checking minimum balance on touch in
- [x] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [x] Write a test that checks that an error is thrown if a card with insufficient balance is touched in
- [x] Write the implementation
- [x] Update existing tests, if necessary, to make sure they still pass
- [x] Refactor to remove any magic numbers and replace with a constant

10. Charging for the journey
- [x] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [x] Write a test that uses `expect {}.to change{}.by()` syntax to check that a charge is made on touch out.
- [x] Update the `touch_out` method to make the test pass
- [x] Make '#deduct' a private method
- [x] Keep the code DRY


11. Saving the entry station

- [x] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB
- [x] Using a double, write a test that expects the card to remember the entry station after the touch in
- [x] Update the `touch_in` method to accept the entry station
- [x] Update existing tests to pass a station to the `touch_in` method - you may need to declare your double in a `let` statement at the top of your describe block
- [x] Expose `entry_station` instance variable using an attribute reader
- [x] Make the card forget the entry station on touch out by setting it to `nil`
- [x] When your tests are all green, refactor to remove the `in_journey` variable. Rewrite the `in_journey?` method to infer its status based on whether or not there is an entry station

DONE#

12. Adding journey history
- [x] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [x] Store the list of journeys as an instance variable and expose it with an attribute reader - you will need to refactor the touch_out method to accept an exit station
- [x] Use a hash to store one journey (set of an entry and exit stations)
- [x] Write a test that checks that the card has an empty list of journeys by default
- [x] Write a test that checks that touching in and out creates one journey
- [x] Keep all code including tests DRY

  DONE

13. Creating the station class
- [x] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB
- [x] Test drive the creation of a Station class that exposes a name and a zone variable
- [x] Use only one expectation per test

  DONE

14. Handling a journey without a touch out
- [x] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [x] Update your test suite to reflect a new Journey class
- [x] Create a new class Journey and move the functionality that relates to a journey from Oystercard to Journey
- [x] Make sure all tests pass, all existing functionality is preserved
- [x] The #fare method should return the minimum fare (for the moment), or the penalty fare of 6 if there was either no entry station or no exit station.
- [x] Make sure the entire codebase is DRY
- [x] Make sure all methods are three lines or shorter

  DONE

15. Extracting the journey log out of the Oystercard
- [x] Write up a plan for how you will interact with your code and manually test in IRB.
- [x] test drive the development of `JourneyLog` class
- [x] Initialise the `JourneyLog` with a `journey_class` parameter (hint: `journey_class` expects an object that knows how to create `Journey`s.  Can you think of an object that already does this?)
- [x] `#start` should start a new journey with an entry station
- [x] a private method `#current_journey` should return an incomplete journey or create a new journey
- [x] `#finish` should add an exit station to the `current_journey`
- [ ] `#journeys` should return a list of all previous journeys without exposing the internal array to external modification
- [ ] remove redundant code from OysterCard class
